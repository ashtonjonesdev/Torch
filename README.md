-------
-------
Discover and stay focused on what is most important to you
* ✅ Discover your torch with guiding questions
* ✅ Stay focused on your torch by limiting you to only being able to set one goal at a time
* ✅ Daily check-in to help you reflect if your actions are aligned with your goal
* ✅ Change your torch at any time
* ✅ See yourself progress by climbing up a mountain the more days you are aligned

## 🚀 Motivation
I wanted a simple app that would help me focus on one overrarching goal while emphasizing progress and the journey towards the goal rather than a specific outcome.

## 🕹 Features
- A simple app that helps you discover and stay focused on what is most important to you
- Uses Android Architecture components, including LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation, and View Binding to make the app robust, stable, and maintainable
- Follows Google's recommended single activity architecture and MVVM design pattern
- Uses Material Design components for a beautiful, consistent design
